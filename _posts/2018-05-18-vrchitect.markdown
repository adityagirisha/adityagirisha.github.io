> Introduction

VRchitect was the tool that me and my team built out as part of our internship in the Microsoft Innovation Lab 2018. The tool was built keeping in mind home owners who would like to see thier homes before its built out in virtual reality.

The tool would take an house blueprint as an input and would render the house in virtual reality which was free to roam and explore using either motion sensors or dedicated controllers. 

A major component was processing the image and recognizing architecture elements such as doors and windows which was done via python image processing.
